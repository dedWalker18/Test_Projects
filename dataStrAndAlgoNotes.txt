An Abstract Data Type is an abstraction of a Data structure that provides only the interface a data structure must adhere to without giving the specific details regarding Implementation .

Complexities : Space & Time

Big-O Notation :
    It gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case scenario, helping to quantify performance as the input becomes ARBITRARILY LARGE.
    For n = the size of input
    Big-O Properties :
        O(n +c) => O(n)
        O(cn) => O(n)
